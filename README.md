Introduction
This is a Python implementation of the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm. CRC is commonly used for error-checking in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.

This program computes the CRC checksum for a given input message using a specified CRC polynomial and returns both the checksum and the transmitted message (message with appended checksum).

Features
Supports any CRC polynomial: Specify the polynomial used for CRC computation.
Message validation: Verify if the received message has been transmitted without error.
Customizable CRC computation: Adjust the algorithm for different use cases.
CRC Algorithm
The CRC algorithm takes a binary message and performs division using binary arithmetic with a predetermined generator polynomial. The remainder of this division is the CRC code, which is appended to the original message.

CRC Formula
𝑅
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑀
(
𝑥
)
∗
𝑥
𝑘
R(x)=M(x)∗x 
k
 
Where:

M(x) is the original message.
G(x) is the generator polynomial.
x^k is a power of 2 used to shift the message.
This program simulates the CRC calculation process and checks the integrity of transmitted messages.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No external dependencies are required.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the crc.py file directly:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crc-python.git
cd crc-python
Ensure Python 3 is installed by running:
bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Usage
You can run the program from the command line or use it as part of a Python project.

Command-line Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where crc.py is located.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python3 crc.py
By default, the program will ask for:
Message: The binary input message.
Polynomial: The binary representation of the CRC polynomial.
Example
For example, if your message is 1101011011 and your polynomial is 10011:

bash
Copy code
Enter the message (binary): 1101011011
Enter the CRC polynomial (binary): 10011
Output:

yaml
Copy code
Original Message: 1101011011
CRC Polynomial: 10011
CRC Checksum: 1100
Transmitted Message: 11010110111100
